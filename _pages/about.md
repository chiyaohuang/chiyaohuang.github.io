Hi there, I am currently an RA working with [Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University. My research focuses on semantic SLAM, learning-based 3D reconstruction, and spatial AI. Before coming to ASU, I was a foundational VR/AR engineer in [HTC VIVE](https://www.vive.com/us/) for three years. I developed a VR/AR tracking technique, which is used in almost all VR/AR products in HTC VIVE. Previously, I received my MS at National Taiwan University with my advisor [Han-Pang Huang](http://ai.robo.ntu.edu.tw/en/personal.php?id=33).
